        This is intended to be my main body of text/ essay about contact
        being a mode of expression that is a dance between life and entrapy which are seeming opposits
        in the universe. A dance of inertia and gravity where you must balance your intention and ability to achieve
        a paticular movement or geometry. Once one can sustain a basic movement in a particular patter the process
        continues
        until multiple small patters combine to form greater patters with higher and higher forms of complexity.
        The greater test is with fire where mistakes can be unforgiving but as with most mistakes in life there's a
        repercussion to a mistake just when mistakes are made with fire swinging around your body the mistakes have
        instant
        feedback.
        What many don't know is that the social factor of performing is often more firghting then the fire. I know that
        when
        I mess up it's because I'm trying to look cool or in some way not truly be who I am and flow. At times you'll
        find
        yourself
        attempting new moves in public because to you what you're doing is lame or too simple but talking to people
        after
        you'll always get a better response when being exactly who you are and flow as you feel and not as you think. It
        is said
        that we should not strive to raise to the occasion but we should sink to our training and this practice
        exemplifies
        I believe this in more then a few ways.
